# Security Update: Firebase Environment Variables

## ⚠️ Critical Security Fix Applied

This update moves Firebase credentials from hardcoded values to environment variables to prevent credential exposure in the codebase.

## What Changed

### 1. Environment Variables Added
- All Firebase credentials are now stored in `.env` file
- `.env.example` template provided for setup
- Environment validation added to prevent runtime errors

### 2. Files Modified
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` - Updated to use `import.meta.env` variables
- `.env` - Contains actual Firebase credentials (gitignored)
- `.env.example` - Template for other developers
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced to exclude sensitive files
- `src/lib/env-verification.ts` - New validation utility

### 3. Environment Variables Used
```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

## Setup Instructions

### For New Developers
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Replace placeholder values with actual Firebase credentials from your Firebase project settings

3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control

### For Production Deployment

#### Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add each `VITE_FIREBASE_*` variable with the production values

#### Other Platforms
Add the environment variables through your hosting platform's environment variable settings.

## Security Benefits

✅ **Before**: Credentials exposed in source code
✅ **After**: Credentials secured in environment variables
✅ **No more**: Risk of credential leaks in git history
✅ **Added**: Runtime validation to prevent missing variables

## Verification

The application now includes automatic environment variable verification:
- Development mode shows masked variable status
- Production mode validates silently
- Missing variables throw descriptive errors

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Never commit `.env` files to git**
⚠️ **Rotate Firebase credentials if they were previously exposed**
⚠️ **Use different Firebase projects for development/production**
